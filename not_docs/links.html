	<p>A corpus is a collection of texts of written (or spoken) language
	presented in electronic form. It provides the evidence of how
	language is used in real situations, from which lexicographers
	can write accurate and meaningful dictionary entries. The Oxford
	English Corpus is at the heart of dictionary-making in Oxford in the
	21st century and ensures that OUP can track and record the very
	latest developments in language today. By analysing the corpus and
	using special software, we can see words in context and find out
	how new words and senses are emerging, as well as spotting other
	trends in usage, spelling, World English, and more.</p>

	<p>The Oxford English Corpus gives us the fullest, most accurate
	picture of the language today. It represents all types of English,
	from literary novels and specialist journals to everyday newspapers
	and magazines as well as the language of chatrooms, emails, and
	weblogs. And, as English is a global language, used by an estimated
	one third of the world’s population, the Oxford English Corpus
	contains language from all parts of the world – not only from the
	UK and the United States but also from Australia, the Caribbean,
	Canada, India, Singapore, and South Africa. It is the largest English
	corpus of its type: the most representative slice of the English language available.</p>

	<p>Oxford Dictionaries are continually monitoring and researching how language is
	evolving. The Oxford English Corpus is central to the process and to Oxford’s £35 million
	research programme – the largest language research programme in the world.</p>

	<p>Meanings of words and phrases change and so do spellings, despite the existence of
	‘standard’ or ‘correct’ spelling. A strength of the corpus is that it contains not only
	published works in which the text has been edited (and made to conform to standard
	spellings and grammar) but also unpublished and unedited writing like emails and
	weblogs.</p>
